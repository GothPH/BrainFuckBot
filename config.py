The Brain Fuck Bot (Compiler)

This bot is easy to use! Just send you BrainFuck code to Bot and it will compile it for you

Note : You cant use input (,) in this bot! This is a simple compiler for print you output, not get input! (Maybe soon!)


Attention : This compilation is not secure! because everybody can compile their codes and control your machine!
So use it for yourself!
